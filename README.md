# To Do List

This is a simple web application that allows you to create and manage your to-do list. With Task Manager, you can easily:

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to your to-do list.
- **Mark Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will have a strike-through.
- **Remove Tasks**: Remove a task by clicking the "x" button next to it.
- **Persistence**: Your tasks are saved locally in your browser's storage, so you won't lose them even if you close the application.
